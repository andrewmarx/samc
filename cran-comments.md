## R CMD check results

Addressing NOTEs from failed 2.0.1 submission:

- Updated the maintainer email address to ajm.rpackages@gmail.com. This is a new email address created for my R packages, and is necessary because I could lose access to my previous email due to a job change. An email from the original maintainer email was sent to CRAN support informing of the situation as well.
- Updated some of the vignette URLs so that they won't show up in the NOTEs. The remaining URLs in the NOTEs work as intended and haven't changed from previous versions of the package where no issues were raised.
- Replaced class check with inherits() function
